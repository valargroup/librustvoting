# Changelog
All notable changes to this workspace will be documented in this file.

and this workspace adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

# Unreleased

## Added
- Added a coarse `share_workflow` planner for wallet SDKs that need crate-owned
  share mode, `submit_at`, and share tracking decisions without moving wallet
  networking or UI loops into `zcash_voting`.

# 0.10.0

## Changed
- Bumped `voting-circuits` to `0.6.0` and removed the workspace patch override,
  so the SDK uses the published circuit crate for delegation proof generation.
- Updated wallet-side governance derivations to call the circuit crate's
  canonical helpers for nullifier domains, governance nullifiers, VAN
  commitments, and rho bindings. This is a breaking cryptographic derivation
  change for delegation proof compatibility.

# 0.9.2

## Fixed
- Matched wallet-side padded note commitments and nullifiers to the synthetic
  padding points introduced by `voting-circuits 0.5.0`, so delegation PIR
  precompute fetches the same padded IMT proofs that proof generation later
  requests.

# 0.9.1

## Added
- Added pure `share_policy`, `pir_snapshot`, and `note_bundling` APIs so wallet
  SDKs can share helper-share timing, exact PIR snapshot selection, and note
  bundle planning logic instead of reimplementing it in each app.

# 0.9.0

## Changed
- Bumped `voting-circuits` to `0.5.0` and updated callers to use its public
  re-exports and upstream circuit key caches.
- Bumped `vote-commitment-tree` to `0.3.0` and
  `vote-commitment-tree-client` to `0.5.0`.
- Removed local wallet-side test/helpers that duplicated vote-commitment and
  El Gamal internals now owned by `voting-circuits`.

# 0.8.1

## Fixed
- Recovery store operations now fail when their target bundle or vote row is
  missing instead of treating a zero-row SQLite update as success.

# 0.8.0

## Changed
- Reset the pre-launch SQLite schema history. Voting databases from interim
  schema versions are now recreated from the current `001_init.sql` baseline
  and marked as schema version 9.

# 0.7.1

## Added
- Added `NoteInfo::from_orchard_note` so SDK FFI layers can reuse the crate's
  Orchard note conversion logic instead of reconstructing `NoteInfo` fields
  themselves.

# 0.7.0

## Changed
- Removed the unused `round_id` parameter from `VotingDb::generate_hotkey`.

## Fixed
- Share payload construction now errors when the requested share is missing its
  blind instead of using empty bytes.
- Recovery now rejects stored commitment bundles that are missing their vote
  commitment tree position instead of assuming position 0.
- Delegation proof generation now requires the randomness saved when the PCZT was
  built instead of sampling fresh randomness when those fields are empty.

# 0.6.0

## Changed
- Bumped `zcash_voting` to `0.6.0`, `vote-commitment-tree` to `0.2.0`, and
  `vote-commitment-tree-client` to `0.4.0` for the breaking commitment leaf
  pagination API.
- Vote commitment tree sync now consumes paginated commitment leaf responses
  with per-block roots instead of issuing one request per height window.

# 0.5.12

## Fixed
- `zcash_voting::action::build_governance_pczt` now guarantees the returned
  `GovernancePczt` describes a single Orchard action: the spend producing
  `nf_signed`, `rk`, and `alpha` is the same action whose output produces
  `cmx_new` and `rseed_output`. The Orchard PCZT builder pads to two actions
  and shuffles spends and outputs independently, so previous calls could
  return metadata mixing two different randomized actions, which later caused
  `build_and_prove_delegation` to fail with `delegation proof result cmx_new
  does not match stored PCZT data`. The construction tail now retries
  `Builder::build_for_pczt` until `spend_idx == output_idx`, fails before
  persistence if no paired layout appears, and re-validates the serialized
  PCZT against the returned `action_index`.

# 0.5.10

## Changed
- Bumped `zcash_voting` to `0.5.10` and updated `voting-circuits` to `0.4.2`.

# 0.5.9

## Added
- Added `VotingDb::has_round` for checking round existence through the storage
  API without downstream callers depending on SQLite schema details.

# 0.5.8

## Added
- `VotingDb::setup_bundles` now persists bundle note identity hashes, and
  `VotingDb::build_governance_pczt`, `VotingDb::precompute_delegation_pir`,
  and `VotingDb::build_and_prove_delegation` reject same-position note
  substitutions for bundles set up under 0.5.8 or later. Bundles persisted by
  earlier releases retain the prior position-only check until they are
  re-setup.

## Fixed
- Delegation proof storage now checks proof-derived public inputs against the
  PCZT-derived values stored during `VotingDb::build_governance_pczt`, and
  stores the proof, public inputs, and round phase atomically.
- `VotingDb::setup_bundles` now persists all bundle rows in a single
  transaction.
- Avoided dropping the Hyper/Tokio transport runtime from inside an active Tokio
  context.

# 0.5.7

## Fixed
- `VotingDb::mark_vote_submitted` now returns an error when no persisted vote
  row matches the requested round, wallet, bundle, and proposal instead of
  treating a zero-row update as success.

# 0.5.6

## Added
- Added a `test-fixtures` feature exposing `VotingDb::insert_vote_fixture`, so
  downstream FFI tests can create vote rows through `VotingDb` instead of
  depending on SQLite schema internals.

# 0.5.5

## Fixed
- Keystone delegation submissions now reject a supplied sighash unless it matches
  the PCZT sighash stored for the bundle.

# 0.5.4

## Fixed
- Delegation submission signing now derives the sender spending key from the
  caller's ZIP-32 `account_index` instead of always using account 0.

# 0.5.3

## Fixed
- **`zcash_voting` `network_id` convention** now matches the wallet SDK everywhere
  (`zkp1::build_and_prove_delegation`, PIR `precompute_delegation_pir` padded
  nullifiers, `zkp2::derive_spending_key`, `vote_commitment::sign_cast_vote`, and
  storage helpers that take `network_id`): **0 = testnet, 1 = mainnet**. The
  padded-nullifier path had previously used the inverse mapping, so `NoteInfo`
  from the SDK could disagree with PIR precompute vs proof generation.

## Changed
- Bumped the `zcash_voting` crate version to `0.5.3`. Direct callers who flipped
  `network_id` to compensate for the old bug should pass the SDK value unchanged
  after upgrading.

# 0.5.2

## Changed
- Reissued the tree-sync transport release from the merged `main` history.
- Confirmed the Hyper/Rustls tree-sync transport against production vote-chain
  endpoints for non-empty rounds.

# 0.5.1

## Changed
- Moved vote commitment tree sync onto the injected transport boundary and
  provided a direct Hyper/Rustls transport from `zcash_voting`.
- Removed `reqwest` from `vote-commitment-tree-client`'s library path.

# 0.5.0

## Changed
- Made `client-pir` transport-agnostic. `zcash_voting` no longer pulls
  `reqwest`; callers must provide a `pir_client::Transport`.
- Added transport-aware PIR precompute/proving entry points so SDKs can provide
  their own HTTP stack.
- Consolidated PIR proof validation and client transport under the single
  `client-pir` feature.
- Added a direct Hyper/Rustls PIR transport under `client-pir` for consumers
  that do not provide their own transport.

# 0.4.1

## Added
- Split the `zcash_voting` network-facing `client` feature into granular
  `client-pir` and `client-tree-sync` features. The existing `client` feature
  remains as a backwards-compatible aggregate of both.
- Made the PIR proof conversion/validation helper available to downstream
  consumers so SDK FFI layers can validate PIR `ImtProofData` without
  enabling vote-commitment-tree sync.

## Changed
- Bumped the `zcash_voting` crate version to `0.4.1` for the additive feature
  split.
